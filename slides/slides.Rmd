## What is a Blog?

## The requisites of our blog

Out aim is to crate a simple blog by the following collection of tools:

- [R](https://www.r-project.org/) + [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html)

- [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) + [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/)

- [GitHub](https://github.com/)

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) + [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

This will allow us to:

- **do not** need a personal web server

- easily include **formulas** and **statistical plot**  
    in our blog posts.
    
## R Markdown

**R Markdown** is a file format to make dynamic documents in **R**. 

An R Markdown document is written in   
**markdown** (an easy-to-write plain text format)   
and contains chunks of **embedded R code**.

### Example:
<ul>
  ````markdown
    # Plotting a simple Histogram 
    
    We generate a number `n=50` of 
    **Normal** disributed random variables 
    and plot them as an histogram
    
    ```{r}`r ''`
     hist(rnorm(50))
    ```   
  ````
</ul>
    
## Plotting a simple Histogram 

We generate a number `n=50` of 
**Normal** disributed random variables 
and plot them as an histogram

```{r}
 hist(rnorm(50))
```  

## blogdown + RStudio

`blogdown` is a package in R, developed by Yihui Xie (also author of `knitr`), that facilitates to build blogs with **R Markdown** in RStudio.

It is mainly tailored for the static generator **Hugo**, but following the author of the package, we tweak it to make it work with the static generator **Jekyll**.


### Book published on 2017: 

["blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown"](https://www.crcpress.com/blogdown-Creating-Websites-with-R-Markdown/Xie-Hill-Thomas/p/book/9780815363729)  
      by Y. Xie, A. P. Hill, A. Thomas
      
it is also available [on-line ](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/)


## GitHub

- Create a repository, for example name it `my_blog`,  
   and **initialize** it with a `README.md`

- Go to `Settings -> GitHub Pages`
    - set **Source** to **master branch**
    - select a **Jekyll theme**, for example to **Minimal**
  
- Edit your repository in the **main** page  
   and set its **website link**

## Associate RStudio with Github

- First download and install    [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) for:
[Linux](https://git-scm.com/download/linux), 
[Mac](http://git-scm.com/download/mac") or
[Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)

- Then enable version control in RStudio 
     by going to  
    `Tools -> Global Options... -> Git/SVN`

- There write the location of the `git` executable

- Then `Create RSA key...` 
    or select one if you already have them.

- Then open the **Terminal**
   by going to  
   `Tools -> Shell...`

- and enter your details for your commits

    ```bash
    git config --global user.email "my.email@university.edu"
    git config --global user.name "my.username"
    ```
    
## Create a new RStudio project

- `File -> New Project... -> Version Control -> Git`
- Type the `url` of your GitHub repository
- Select a name and a location for your RStudio project 


Then

- assure to have the package `blogdown` installed

  ```r
  ## Install from CRAN
  install.packages("blogdown")
  ## Or, install from GitHub
  if (!requireNamespace("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
  devtools::install_github("rstudio/blogdown")
  ```

## Configuring Jekyll on GitHub Pages

- Set the file content `_config.yml` as follows

  ```yaml
  title: My first blog
  description: >- # this means to ignore newlines until "email:"
    "This blog has been creatged during the mini-course 
    'Blogging with R' by Bernardo D'Auria on Tue March 26th, 2019"
  email: my.email@university.edu

  # Build settings
  markdown: kramdown
  exclude: ['*.Rmd'] 
  theme: minima
  plugins:
    - jekyll-feed # to serve posts
  ```
  
  - Create the folder `_posts` 
  
## Configuring Jekyll on GitHub Pages

- Create the file `Gemfile`

  ```yaml
  source "https://rubygems.org"
  
  # To upgrade, run `bundle update github-pages`.
  gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins
  
  group :jekyll_plugins do
    gem "jekyll-feed"
  end
  ```
  
- Add to `.gitignore`
  ```bash
  _site/
  .sass-cache/
  .jekyll-cache/
  .jekyll-metadata
  ```

## Adding an `index.html` page

- Create the file `index.Rmd`  

  ````md
     ---
      layout: home
      title: "Welcome to my Blog"
     ---
      
      ```{r, echo=FALSE}`r ''`
      library(ggplot2)
      
      ## Plot
      g <- ggplot(mpg, aes(cty))
      g + geom_density(aes(fill=factor(cyl)), alpha=0.8) + 
          labs(title="Density plot", caption="Source: mpg", 
               x="City Mileage", fill="# Cylinders")
      ```
      
  ````
  
- Run `knitr::knit('index.Rmd')`

## Making our first post

- Create the file `_posts/2019-03-01-HelloWorld.Rmd`  

  ````markdown
      ---
      title: "Hello World!"
      author: "Bernardo D'Auria"
      date: "2019-03-01"
      ---
      Let us sum `1+1` by **R**.
      
      ```{r}`r ''`
      1+1
      ```
      
  ````
- Run  

  ```r
    setwd('_posts/'); 
    knitr::knit('2019-03-17-HelloPage.Rmd'); setwd('..');
  ```

## The blog works!

- `Commit` and `Push`

Now going to the url of the **GitHub Pages** of our repository,

the blog <font color='red'>WORKS!</font>

### To run it locally:

You need to have **Jekyll** installed

- run `bundle install`  
- run `jekyll serve` 
- open in the browser the url `http://127.0.0.1:4000/`

## Jekyll

`Jekyll` is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator perfect for personal, project, or organization sites. 

Jekyll is the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host sites right from your GitHub repositories. 

- to install Jekyll see the instructions for different platforms  [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)

- Jekyll may require to download and install a more recent version of [Ruby language](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)



## Jekyll as generator for blogdown

- create an hidden file `.Rprofile` in the RStudio project directory  

   ```bash
   options(
     blogdown.generator = 'jekyll', blogdown.method = 'custom',
     blogdown.subdir = '_posts', servr.daemon = TRUE
   )
   ```

- Add to the configuration file `_config.yml` the following line:  

   ```bash
   exclude: ['*.Rmd']  
   ```
  
- create a new folder `R` containing the files  
    [`build.R`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yihui/blogdown-jekyll/gh-pages/R/build.R) and 
    [`build_one.R`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yihui/blogdown-jekyll/gh-pages/R/build_one.R)

They can be dowloaded from [yihui/blogdown-jekyll](https://github.com/yihui/blogdown-jekyll) repository


## Content of `build.R`

```r

```

## Content of `build_one.R`


```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
summary(cars)
```

## Slide with Plot

```{r pressure}
plot(pressure)
```
