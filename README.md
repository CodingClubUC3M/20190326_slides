# Blogging with R  
talk given at **Coding Club UC3M**

Day: Tuesday **March 26th**, 2019  
Time: **16:30 - 17:30**

### Abstract:

In this talk, we will build a simple blog using R-Markdown, Jekyll and GitHub pages.
We will use the blogdown package for R that allows to easily build a personal blog containing scientific contents,
such as professional plots (made by ggplot2) and mathematical formulas.

The choice for GitHub pages allows to build a blog for free and without any need of a personal server.
The talk will show a simple and ready to use workflow to make and handle a personal blog.
Then, depending on time, it will address stylistic issues and/or advanced content publications.

### Requirements:
- tidyverse and blogdown packages for R, better to have also installed the [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) IDE
- a free account on [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) static website generator
